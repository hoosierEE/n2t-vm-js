* JavaScript backend for Nand2Tetris Virtual Machine
This project provides a software emulation of the Nand2Tetris virtual machine.

Like the VM Emulator provided by the Nand2Tetris authors, this backend accepts .vm files as input.
The backend allows you to pause and resume VM execution, inspect or manipulate the virtual RAM contents at any time, and run simple test scripts.

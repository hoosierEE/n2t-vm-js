* Unnamed Virtual Machine
This project implements an interpreter for a stack-based VM in your browser.

It is based on the Nand2Tetris VM Translator, but has some differences:

1. (todo) no top-level labels or gotos, labels will only be allowed inside functions.
2. interpreted rather than ahead-of-time translated
3. function definitions end with an explicit =end= keyword
